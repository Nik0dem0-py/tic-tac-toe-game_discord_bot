BEFORE YOU COPY THE CODE:

Install the discord.py library:

You need atleast Python 3.5.3

# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py


Change (your token), into your bot's discord token which is TOKEN = '(your token)'
The prefix is t! by default, you can change it where client = commands.Bot(command_prefix='t!', case_insensitive=True) is located

Now you can run your python TicTacToe bot!
